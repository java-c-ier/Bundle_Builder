# Project Description

This project is a static but interactive "Bundle Builder" UI, created with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a common e-commerce feature where users can select multiple products from a grid to create a custom bundle. The interface dynamically updates a sidebar to show selected items, track progress, calculate the subtotal, and automatically apply a discount once the bundle criteria are met.
